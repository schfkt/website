I’m an experienced backend developer mostly focused on Node.js stack, solving problems with TypeScript and sometimes with JavaScript. During the last couple of years I also got experienced with Golang, using it for different kind of tasks ranging from simple CRUD APIs to image and audio processing services. On top of that I have experience with MongoDB, MySQL (MariaDB), Redis and RabbitMQ.

I had experience working in a completely remote team for 3 years in the past. That was an interesting challenge, and it really helped me to get better at managing my time and to learn to communicate efficiently.

I’m an avid learner and a very curious person who always tries to get to know how things work under the hood. Since I believe, it’s the best way to truly understand something.

Apart from that, I really like sports: swimming, cycling, running.
