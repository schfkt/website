Iâ€™m a seasoned software engineer specialized on Go and Node.js stacks. During the past years I've been mostly
working with Go, using it for different kinds of tasks ranging from simple CRUD APIs to image and audio processing
services.

I also shoot photos occasionally, you can find it there [Photo Gallery](https://photo.schfkt.dev).
