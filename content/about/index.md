I’m a seasoned backend developer specialized on Go and Node.js stacks. During the past years I've been mostly
working with Go, using it for different kinds of tasks ranging from simple CRUD APIs to image and audio processing
services. On top of that I have experience with MariaDB (MySQL), MongoDB, Redis and RabbitMQ.

I’m an avid learner and a very curious person who always tries to get to know how things work under the hood. Since I
believe, it’s the best way to truly understand something.

Apart from that, I really like sports: swimming, strenght training.

I also shoot photos occasionally, you can find it there [Photo Gallery](https://photo.schfkt.dev).
