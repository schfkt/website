  Hello there
</h1>

<p>
  My name is Pavel and this is my personal place where I share my thoughts
  with the rest of the world. Mostly in English, but some of the old posts are in Russian.
  Currently I live in the sunny Cyprus with my girlfriend and a dog.
  Here are a few words about me.
</p>

<p>
  I’m an experienced backend developer mostly focused on Node.js stack,
  solving problems with TypeScript and sometimes with JavaScript. On top
  of that I have experience with MongoDB, MySQL (MariaDB) and Redis.
  Also I’m proficient with Docker and Kubernetes and I have good
  knowledge of Bash as an automation tool, since I’ve written many scripts
  for CI/CD pipeline.
</p>

<p>
  I had experience working in a completely remote team for 3 years in the
  past. That was an interesting challenge, and it really helped me to get
  better at managing my time and to learn to communicate efficiently.
</p>

<p>
  The most important thing for me is quality. Be that code, documentation,
  whatever surrounds software development – I strive to make it at the
  highest level. Of course, it’s not always possible because of the time
  constraints, so I know how to keep balance here.
</p>

<p>
  I’m an avid learner and a very curious person who always tries to get to
  know how things work under the hood. Since I believe, it’s the best way
  to truly understand something.
</p>

<p>
  Apart from that, I really like sports: swimming, cycling, running. My goal
  for this year (2019) is to participate in a triathlon.
