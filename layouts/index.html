  <h1>Hello there</h1>

  <p>
    My name is Pavel and this is my personal place where I share thoughts with the
    rest of the world. Mostly in English, but some of the old posts are in Russian.
    Currently I live in the sunny Cyprus with my girlfriend and a dog.

    Iâ€™m a backend developer mostly focused on Node.js stack, solving problems
    with TypeScript and sometimes with JavaScript. I also like to automate things with
    bash. <a href="/about">Want to learn more?</a>
